        <h1>Methodology</h1>
        <div class="methodology-body">
            <p>There are 5 main variables that make up my advanced polling average model:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Historic Trend</li>
                <li>Historic Polling Error</li>
                <li>Candidate Favorability</li>
                <li>Betting Odds</li>
                <li>Current Polling Averages</li>
                <li>Third Party Trend</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Note: this model does not use any national polling data. It is exclusively state-by-state.<br /><br />Let's go through each data point and see how it affects the model.</p>
            <h3>Historic Trend</h3>
            <p>To get the historic trend, I take the difference between the 2020 election state margins and the 2004 state margins and divide it by 5 to get the average trend on a per-election basis.</p>
            <h3>Historic Polling Error</h3>
            <p>To get the historic polling error, I take each state's 2016 and 2020 actual margin minus its polling average and get the average.</p>
            <h3>Candidate Favorability</h3>
            <p>To get each candidates favorability, I use civiqs, because, as far as I know, they are the only ones polling candidate favorability in every state.</p>
            <h3>Betting Odds</h3>
            <p>To get betting odds, I use polymarket, because it is the only site with state-level odds.</p>
            <h3>Current Polling Averages</h3>
            <p>To get current polling averages, I take the average of RealClearPolling and 270 to Win for each state. If the state does not have any polling data, I take the average of the 2016 and 2020 actual margins as well as polling averages.</p>
            <h3>Third Party Trend</h3>
            <p>Although RFK Jr. has dropped out of the race, he has had and will have a noticable effect on this race. In order to account for this, I took the 2020 third party vote share as a percent and subtracted it with the same data from 2016 to get the trend. I then added 10% to this number to account for RFK JR's impact.</p>
            <h2>Putting it all together</h2>
            <p>Here is the formula I use to calculate the expected margin for each state:</p>
            <p>((((Polling Average * Historic Trend) + ((Betting Odds * (1 - Historic Trend)) * Absolute Value of Historic Polling Error) * 5) + ((Trump Favorability + Kamala Favorability + 15%) / 2)) / 6) + Polling Error + (Third Party Percent * 41%) - (Third Party Percent * 27%)</p>
